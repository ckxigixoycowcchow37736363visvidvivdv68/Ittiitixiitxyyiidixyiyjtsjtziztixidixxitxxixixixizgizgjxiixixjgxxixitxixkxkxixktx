  <h1>MIGHTY MAN (1830)</h1>

  <p><strong>This story is called Mighty Man (1830).</strong></p>

  <h2>PRESENT — DUSK (EVENING)</h2>

  <p>
    The story begins at dusk, in the evening.  
    The wind is strong.
  </p>

  <p>
    Curls of wind and dust rise into the air. Leaves, wooden particles, and everything around move with the wind, following nature’s cycle.  
    But some things never follow nature’s ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two villains are holding our hero, <strong>Mighty Man</strong>, tightly by both arms.  
    They struggle with all their strength to control him. They force him down to his knees, but he keeps resisting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly, more villains bring his girlfriend to the scene.  
    That day, the park turns into an open arena.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Mighty Man sees her, his strength begins to fade.  
    His enemies notice this weakness. Sweat pours down his face, and finally, he is forced to kneel on the ground.
  </p>

  <p><em>A hand rises…</em></p>

  <p>
    A villain removes his armored helmet to see his face.
  </p>

  <p>
    One by one, the others step forward in anger.  
    Punches rain down again and again until blood spills from his mouth.  
    His face becomes badly bruised. His eyes swell, and his entire face is battered by the enemies’ blows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seeing the blood on his face, his girlfriend is terrified.  
    Tears pour from her eyes like a waterfall. She screams for them to stop.
  </p>

  <p>
    A villain slaps her to silence her.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mighty Man looks at her, helpless and broken.  
    Blood continues to drip from his face.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even the birds in the sky seem disturbed by this horrifying and cruel scene.  
    Darkness slowly begins to consume the light as the sun starts to set.
  </p>

  <p>
    The raised hand moves again, trying to place his helmet back on…  
    <strong>But it is already too late.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    His girlfriend is gone forever.  
    An enemy steps forward and presses a knife against her neck…
  </p>

  <p>
    Our hero is completely surrounded.  
    From every side, sinister figures step forward.
  </p>

  <h3>Gang Families Present</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Dwarf Twin Brothers Gang</li>
    <li>The Godfather Gang</li>
    <li>The Laughing Wolf Gang</li>
    <li>The Devil Gang</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All of them watch in silence.  
    Mighty Man stands alone at the center—<br>
    <strong>broken, unarmed, and trapped.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>FLASHBACK — AFTERNOON, NEW YORK (1830)</h2>

  <p>
    Earlier that same day…
  </p>

  <p>
    In the afternoon streets of New York, a boy named <strong>Robert</strong> is chasing another boy named <strong>Alan</strong>.  
    Robert’s face is filled with anger. There is some kind of problem between the two kids.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alan suddenly hides behind an apple tree.  
    Robert notices Alan peeking out from behind it, but he doesn’t pay much attention and walks past the tree.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly, Alan jumps out from behind and grabs Robert.  
    They both fall to the ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alan uses all his strength to hold him down.  
    Robert tries to get up but falls again.
  </p>

  <p>
    In fear, Alan calls out softly, <br>
    <em>“James!”</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    Suddenly, a dog barks loudly from behind Robert.  
    Startled, Robert falls once more.
  </p>

  <p>
    A boy named <strong>James</strong> appears.  
    He smiles calmly and commands the dog—named <strong>Lion</strong>—to stop.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lion obeys.
  </p>

  <p>
    James helps Robert to his feet and asks what happened between him and Alan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Robert says, <br>
    <em>
      “It’s my problem. He slapped my back, so I chased him.  
      I wanted to teach him a lesson so he wouldn’t do it again.”
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    James listens quietly.  
    Then he smiles slightly and thinks to himself, <br>
    <em>“Where is Alan now?”</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    James looks around and sees Alan walking toward his home.  
    Alan steps inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    James watches in silence.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    James is a high-status and wealthy kid.  
    Alan and Robert are both his friends, but they come from a poor background.
  </blockquote>
